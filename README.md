Bootable OpenCore EFI Folder and the relevant files used to make it. Made for the HP EliteBook 2570p, with macOS Monterey in mind. Initially based on OpenCore 0.8.5, updated to OpenCore 0.8.8.

**<ins>PLEASE READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING THIS EFI.</ins>**

***I will not be held responsible for any bricks just because you were too lazy to read.***

<ins>Even then, use this EFI at your own risk and only if you know what you're doing and can edit the config.plist according to your own hardware and needs.</ins>

## Considerations
   ### macOS
   - You can install any macOS Monterey version, either with a full installer or through recovery. <ins>This EFI folder has not been tested with any other macOS, and therefore does not have support for anything other than macOS Monterey.</ins> If you want to install a different version, see: **"What if I need > macOS Monterey?"**
   ### Requirements
   - While officially you only need 4GB of RAM, I personally recommend no less than 8GB running in [dual channel](https://www.crucial.com/articles/about-memory/what-is-dual-channel-memory) and using a SATA SSD at the very least to get reasonable performance. However, this is optional and completely up to you.
   - You ***NEED*** to have the exact same model or, at the very least, have a [same generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)) CPU and iGPU to use this config.plist as is.
   ### config.plist
   - You need to have emulated NVRAM enabled by setting `LoadEarly` to `True` for both OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi. ***You cannot boot if this is configured incorrectly after the initial install. Be careful when snapshotting with [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) as it resets the*** `LoadEarly` ***value to*** `False`***. This has the potential to break booting completely and will warrant a full reinstall.*** If you have questions, see: **"What if I don't know how to enable emulated NVRAM?"**
   - Before using this EFI make sure to generate your own SMBIOS information with [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) using `MacBookPro10,1` and place it in `PlatformInfo` before being able to use this EFI. If you don't know how to do this, see: **"What if I don't know how to use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)?"**
   - ***You cannot enable SIP, Secure Boot or remove the*** `-no_compat_check` ***boot arg or you will break booting.*** For more information, see: **"What if I want to enable SIP?"**, **"What if I want to enable Secure Boot?"**, and **"What if I want to remove the boot arg?"**
   - `AppleXcpmCfgLock` has to stay enabled as CFG Lock can't be disabled through normal means. We don't use `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` as we have enabled XCPM.

## BIOS
   ### Settings
   Set `Boot Options` > `Startup Menu Delay (Sec.)` to `05`. (This will give you a chance to enter the BIOS just in case you need to change anything, as I have found that it sometimes boots very quickly when using a SATA SSD.)
   
   Set `Boot Options` > `User Mode` to `HP Factory Keys`. (If you already had this set to `Customer Keys`, you can leave this setting as is.)
   
   Set `Boot Options` > `Boot Mode` to `UEFI Native (Without CSM)`. (We don't need CSM for macOS.)
   
   Set `Device Configurations` > `Max SATA Speed` to `6.0 Gbps`. (The higher the number, the faster your hard drive can perform.)
   
   Set `Device Configurations` > `SATA Device mode` to `AHCI`. (`IDE` is obsolete and `RAID` should only be used if you are using more than one drive.)
   
   Set `Device Configurations` > `Express Card Link Speed` to `Generation 2`. (The higher the number, the faster your Express/Expansion card can perform.)
   
   Set `Device Configurations` > `Smart Card Reader Power Setting (if present)` to `Powered on if card is present`. (Helps reduce overall power consumption.)
   
   Set `Device Configurations` > `Deep sleep` to `Auto`. (In my research, setting this to either `On` or `Off` breaks Sleep in macOS.)
   
   Set `Built-In Device Options` > `Wake on LAN` to `Disable`. (In my research, setting this to `Boot to Network` or `Follow Boot Order` also breaks sleep in macOS.)

## Known Issues
- WiFi is sometimes spotty in recovery, I recommend using the full installer which you can grab from a real Mac by using [MIST](https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist/releases) (Requires â‰¤ macOS Monterey), using Munki's InstallInstallMacOS utility, see [Making the installer in macOS](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/mac-install.html#downloading-macos-modern-os), or downloading through an ethernet connection.
- USB file transfers can sometimes be slow. It seems to happen on other hackintoshes too, though.
- Neither pressing keyboard keys or using the trackpad wakes the laptop from sleep, but pressing the power button once does.
- Boot chime volume is rather low, but I have not been able to figure out how the new UEFI Audio settings work.
- Webcam image is pretty dark.
- Some keyboard keys have weird behavior, such as `fn+Right arrow key` & `fn+Left arrow key` which also change brightness in addition to `fn+f9` & `fn+f10`. Seems to be related to VoodooPS2Controller.
 - You can use the power button to power on the laptop initally, but once it's turned on, pressing the button once quickly does not make it go to sleep. If you hold it down for about 1.5-2 seconds and then let go, it does go to sleep, and will wake up from a quick press. If you hold it down for 5 seconds, it will still shut down the laptop as normal.
- The supplemental battery information, like cycle count, temperature, etc., hasn't been patched in yet.
- The eSATA Port has been tested as a normal USB 3.0 port and it works fine, but haven't been able to test it as an actual eSATA port.
- The hardware Wi-Fi shortcut button has very strange behavior, it works for disabling, but when trying to re-enable, it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. You need to disable and re-enable WiFi from macOS to fix it, which kind of defeats the purpose. However, it does change colors depending on the current on or off status.
- The hardware browser shortut button does nothing.
- The hardware audio shortcut button works fine, but the light stays orange no matter what state audio is in, and turns white when sleep is activated.
- The WiFi card should be replaced with a WiFi + Bluetooth card for Airdrop, Continuity, etc. support.
- No DRM support for iGPU in macOS Monterey + a dGPU is needed, see [Fixing DRM Support and iGPU Performance](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/drm.html). A workaround is to use a non-hardware DRM based browser, such as [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or Chromium-based browsers such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- No VGA support in macOS Monterey.
- No Airdrop, Sidecar, etc. because of no Bluetooth.
- Trackpoint isn't working. This seems to be caused by VoodooPS2Controller. In my testing, the keyboard and trackpad work decently when using RehabMan's 2018 version of VoodooPS2, but not the trackpoint. If I switch over to the newer VoodooPS2Controller which uses VoodooInput, the trackpoint works, but nothing else.
- No gestures.
- Modem devices are detected, but have no support in macOS.
- Fingerprint scanner does not work as there is currently no way to emulate Touch ID, see [Hardware Limitations](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/macos-limits.html#miscellaneous).
- CFG Lock can't be disabled in the BIOS.
- "About This Mac" doesn't show the "Memory" tab. This is normal however, as we have no way to change this without changing the SMBIOS, even if we change `SystemMemoryStatus` in the config.plist. See the `PlatformInfo` section of [Configuration.pdf](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf):
> Note: On certain Mac models, such as the MacBookPro10,x and any MacBookAir, SPMemoryReporter.spreporter
will ignore PT_FEATURE_HAS_SOLDERED_SYSTEM_MEMORY and assume that system memory is non-upgradable.
- Trackpad/trackpoint aren't working in the OpenCanopy Picker, with or without PS2MouseDxe.efi. Keyboard is fine.
- No sound plays when connecting a charger (PowerChime) by default. To fix this, open Terminal and type: `defaults write com.apple.PowerChime ChimeOnAllHardware -bool true; open /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app &`. (See the [MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/) article: [How to Change or Disable Your MacBook's Charging Sound](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/make-mac-play-sound-plug-charger/)).
- AirPlay to Mac does not work when using a 5GHz WiFi band.

## Instructions
1. Test, test, test. I ***DO NOT*** recommend placing this EFI directly on your main hard drive EFI partiton without swapping from RELEASE to DEBUG and test booting from USB first. If you need guidance on how to test boot from USB, see: **"What if I don't know how to test an EFI folder?"**
2. Once tested and confirmed working, you will need to download [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) to patch the Intel HD Graphics 4000 iGPU to get graphics acceleration working. If you need guidance on how to do this, see: **"What if I don't know how to use OpenCore Legacy Patcher?"**
3. Once fully patched, you can swap back from DEBUG to RELEASE.

## SD Card Reader
To enable the SD Card Reader, download [JMicron-Card-Reader](https://github.com/chris1111/JMicron-Card-Reader) from [chris1111](https://github.com/chris1111) and install it. Security & Privacy will ask you to allow the new extensions, so allow them and reboot. (**Note:** You might have to reboot a second time.) Once rebooted the SD Card Reader should be fully working.

## "What if...?"
| "What if...?" | Answer |
| ------------- | ------ |
| "What if I need > macOS Monterey?" | You will most likely need to make your own EFI folder from scratch. |
| "What if I don't know how to enable emulated NVRAM?" | Starting with [OpenCore 0.8.3](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/tag/0.8.3), emulated NVRAM is now under it's own separate driver, OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi, which depends on a couple of things to actually work: OpenRuntime.efi has to be specified after OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi in the `Drivers` list, OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi needs to have `LoadEarly` set to `True`, and OpenRuntime.efi also has to have `LoadEarly` set to `True` for the correct operation of `RequestBootVarRouting` when using both OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi. So, yeah, a couple of things, but usually only setting `LoadEarly` to `True` for both OpenRuntime.efi and OpenVariableRuntimeDxe.efi does the trick, at least for me. This also ties into breaking booting, as SIP is disabled in NVRAM, and so if NVRAM were to stop working, SIP would turn on and destroy everything. |
| "What if I don't know how to use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)?" | You first will want to download [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and extract it, then run `GenSMBIOS.py`. Choose option `1` to install macserial, then option `3` to generate your SMBIOS info. Type `MacBookPro10,1` then press enter, and you should get all the info you need to place in your config.plist. For more info, see: [PlatformInfo](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/ivy-bridge.html#platforminfo).
| "What if I want to enable SIP?" | Due to the use of [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) and [JMicron-Card-Reader](https://github.com/chris1111/JMicron-Card-Reader), which both require SIP to be off and stay off, we cannot re-enable it without completely breaking booting. I know, because I tried. |
| "What if I want to enable Secure Boot?" | You can't enable Secure Boot with the `MacBookPro10,1` SMBIOS we are using, as Secure Boot was not a feature of that SMBIOS.|
| "What if I want to remove the boot arg?" | We use the boot arg `-no_compat_check` so that macOS doesn't check for board compatibility with our SMBIOS. This also ties into breaking booting, because of the boot arg being NVRAM dependent. If NVRAM were to stop working or the boot arg were to be removed, we would be either unable to boot or greeted with a forbidden symbol when booting. We use the `MacBookPro10,1` SMBIOS because it was written for Ivy Bridge, which helps use less energy and produce less heat than if we were using the `MacBookPro11,1` SMBIOS, which was written for Haswell. This also has the added benefit of giving us the correct P and C-States for our processor. While you *can* use a different SMBIOS, `MacBookPro10,1` is the best one for this laptop.|
| "What if I want to use a custom boot logo?" | All you need to do is rename your EFI partition to "HP_TOOLS" and place the Hewlett-Packard folder into that same partition. You can change the provided Apple logo in the Hewlett-Packard folder if you want to use a different one. |
| "What if I'm not familiar with the ACPI/SSDT/Patch files in the EFI?" | Check the *EFI Files Explained* section below. |
| "What if I don't know what hardware I have?" | Well, honestly you shouldn't even try to use this EFI, but see: [Finding your Hardware](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/find-hardware.html). |
| "What if I don't know how to test an EFI folder?" | The first thing you should do is download OpenCore 0.8.5 DEBUG and replace the files in the EFI with the ones in the OpenCore download. The main ones to replace are listed in the *Debugging File Swaps* table below. You can then enable debugging settings, see: [OpenCore Debugging](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/debug.html#config-changes) and [System Debugging](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/kernel-debugging.html#config-plist-setup). Now all you have to do is put that new debugging-enabled EFI on a USB and boot! You can check what could be causing problems or panics when trying to boot, and the logs should save to your USB drive. |
| "What if I don't know how to use [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/releases)?" | After installing macOS Monterey, you'll notice that you have no iGPU acceleration and everything chugs along *very* slowly. To fix this, we download [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/releases), run it, re-launch as root, click on `Post Install Root Patch`, click on `Apply Patches`, and wait for the prompt to reboot. After rebooting, iGPU acceleration should now be fully working. If you update through Software Update this patch will be removed and you will have repeat this process. Note that [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) automatically detects when the patches have been removed and will prompt you to patch again. |

## EFI Files Explained
### ACPI/SSDTs
| Name | Function |
| ---- | -------- |
| SSDT-AC | This patch attaches an AC Adapter Device that already exists in the DSDT to the `AppleACPIACAdapter` service in the IORegistry of macOS. This is optional and mostly cosmetic â€“ it doesn't make any difference in terms of functionality, see: [Emulate a layer of AppleACPIACAdapter](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1808). |
| SSDT-ALS0 | Starting with macOS Catalina, laptops either require a fake ambient light sensor device `(ALS0)` or, if the laptop has one, `(ALSD)` needs to be enabled for macOS to store the current brightness/auto-brightness level. Otherwise, the brightness level returns to the maximum level after every reboot. For us, this patch adds `(ALS0)` as we do not have an ambient light sensor. |
| SSDT-EC | On laptops, the `EC` is used for enabling hotkeys and correct battery management. The problem is our `EC`'s name isn't compatible, so this patch creates a simple "fake" `EC` device that will satisfy macOS. |
| SSDT-FHWD | This patch adds a virtual `FWHD` device to the IORegistry in macOS. Research of DSDT and `.ioreg` files shows that the `Intel Firmware Hub Device` is present in almost every Intel-based Mac. It's listed in IORegistryExplorer as `FWHD` with the HID `INT0800`. |
| SSDT-HPET | Sound cards on older systems (Ivy Bridge, for example) require `High Precision Event Timer` (`HPET PNP0103`) to provide interrupts `0` and `8`, otherwise the sound card won't work, even if AppleALC is present and the correct `layout-id` is used. In most cases, almost all machines have `HPET` without any interrupts. Usually, interrupts `0` & `8` are occupied by `RTC PNP0B00` or `TIMR PNP0100` respectively. To solve this issue, we need to fix `HPET`, `RTC` and `TIMR` simultaneously. This patch fixes `HPET` to enable sound. |
| SSDT-LANC & SSDT-UPRW | macOS will instantly wake if ethernet or power states change while sleeping. To fix this, we need to reroute the `LANC` & `UPRW` calls to a new SSDT, which is what this patch does. |
| SSDT-PNLF| This patch creates a `PNLF` device for macOS to use for brightness controls, specifically a `PNLF` device with a hardware ID of `APP0002`. |
| SSDT-XCPM | Apple deactivated the `X86PlatformPlugin` support for Ivy Bridge in macOS a few years back. Instead, the `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` is used for CPU power management, although XCPM is supported by Ivy Bridge CPUs natively. This patch brings back XCPM power management. |

### Patches
| Name | Function |
| ---- | -------- |
| BoardIDSkip + VMM | Enables booting macOS Monterey with an unsupported Board ID and adds patches that [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) uses to trick macOS into thinking it's running on a virtual machine. |
| Enable XCPM | Patches for enabling XCPM power management, used with SSDT-XCPM. |
| IRQ-HPET | Patches for `HPET` to fix sound issues, used with SSDT-HPET. |
| UPRW & LANC Rename | Patches for fixing power state & ethernet changes instantly waking macOS. |
